# How metric values are calculated
{: #metric_calculation}

{{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} is deprecated. As of 1 Augest 2019, you cannot provision new {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} instances on public region. Existing service instances are supported until 30 September 2019. To continue the auto-scaling capability for Cloud Foundray application in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, please migrate to the NEW [built-in Auto-Scaling experience on Cloud Foundry application](https://{DomainName}/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-autoscale_cloud_foundry_apps). {:deprecated}

For dynamic scaling, an application is scaled against a selected runtime metric type . 
{{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service collects runtimes metrics through different data source.

For Liberty for Java, Node.js and Swift, {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service replies on an embedded "{{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} agent" which is injected into the application container to report its runtime metrics with "push" model.
For the other runtime types, {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service pulls the metrics from cloud controller directly. 

The following figure shows how {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} collect metrics:
![How {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service collects the metric](images/collect_metric.png "{{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service collects the metric") 

Given the different data collection approach in {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service,  the supported metric for each runtime type is diverse. <br>
Also, even for the same metric type, i.e. memory, the value of the metric is calculated in different approach with various runtime type.

<br/>{{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} service calculates the metric values in the following ways: 
* "Memory" metric collected from Cloud Foundry: the value is the memory usage as percentage of memory limit of the application instance <br>
Cloud Foundry computes the memory usage from the "memory.stat" of cgroup with the formula below: <br>
`memory_usage = total_rss + total_cache - total_inactive_file`
   * total_cache:  memory used for page cache
   * total_rss:    memory resident in main memory (RAM)
   * total_inactive_file:  file-backed memory on inactive LRU list

* Metrics collected by Auto-Scaling data collector: <br/>
  * "Memory" metric: the value is the memory usage as percentage of  memory limit of the application instance.<br> 
  {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} data collector grabs  memory usage with the [rss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_set_size) value in file */proc/{pid}/stat*: <br/> 
  `memory_usage = RSS (total memory actually held in RAM for a process)`
  * "Heap" metric: the value is the heap usage as percentage of the maximum heap size
  * "Response time" metric:  
     The value is the total elapsed time (in milliseconds) of all processed requests occurred in a time window (aka *report interval*) divided by the duration of the time window. 
  * "Throughput" metric:  
     The value is the average number of processed requests per second per application instance.


## Limitations
{: #limitations}

* For Java application using IBM Liberty buildpack,  {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} data collector uses [Liberty Monitor-1.0 feature -> ServletStats MXBean](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_mon_webapp.html) to collect the metrics. Pay attention to the following constraints  when Response time/Throughput metric is used for scaling.
   * Your application must be deployed as Liberty web application so that Liberty web container and Liberty Monitor-1.0 feature are loaded to collect the metrics. Spring Boot application deployed as a "Main-Classs" application or using embedded Tomcat server does not use Liberty web container, therefore no metrics data will be collected. 
   * The requests going to static HTML page are not captured by {{site.data.keyword.autoscaling}} data collector given no servlet is hit. For example, if you deploy the starter web-application of [Liberty for Java Runtime](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/liberty-for-java) and run load test against its root URL which is a static HTML page, the reported Response time/Throughput metric will be 0.   
* For Swift application, only Kitura framework is supported <br/>
